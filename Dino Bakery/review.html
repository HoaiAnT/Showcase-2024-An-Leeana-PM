            Service was really nice, and the desserts they sell are just as
            sweet! The Oreo Ice Cream Cake is amazing in the island’s
            summer breeze!

            Pretty good, but I prefer savory over sweet. Someone could
            definitely get sick easily from the amount of sugar in these.
            Luckily didn’t have spend much here.

            I have a very sweet tooth, and this shop is very sweet.
            Recommended for those visiting Jurassic Park to come and visit
            this place and buy a treat, specifically the Raspberry Panna
            Cotta.

            This shop has an amazing atmosphere, and the people are really
            nice. The treats are to die for, especially the Donauwelle, just
            a quick stop by for each time I go back to the lodge.

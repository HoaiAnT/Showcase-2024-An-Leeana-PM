            <p class="esta">
                Since 1990, We have unconditionally created sweet and delicious desserts thanks to John Hammond.
                He has supported our funding and establishment to bake treats during your stay at Jurassic park.
                It has been an honor to have been chosen to create pastries for this theme park. As Lex and Tim
                Murphy has come by often to taste the wonders that the Jurassic Olive Bake has to offer.

            <h3 class="story">Our Story</h3>
            <p class="story">
                It starts with a chance, an opportunity, and our opportunity started when John Hammond offered to
                create a pastry shop in Jurassic park. He gathered all sorts of chefs around the world, and around
                bakeries. Working together, we mead a menu suitable and traditional to South America’s pallet, as
                they had some exotic taste that would fit in with Jurassic’s theme.
            </p>

            <h3 class="esta">Establishment</h3>
            <p class="esta">Only 3 locations exist throughout Jurassic Park since the making of Jurassic Park. One is
                located in the northern regions, one southern, and one western. All selling our signature items, but 
                different menu items based on the establishment that is closest to your location. All locations should 
                be located in a food court of some kind, containing various other sweet delights after a savory meal.</p>

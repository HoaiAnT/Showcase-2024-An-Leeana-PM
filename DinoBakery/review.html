                    Service was really nice, and the desserts they sell are just as
                    sweet! The Oreo Ice Cream Cake is amazing in the island’s
                    summer breeze!

                    Pretty good, but I prefer savory over sweet. Someone could
                    definitely get sick easily from the amount of sugar in these.
                    Luckily didn’t have spend much here.

                    I have a very sweet tooth, and this shop is very sweet.
                    Recommended for those visiting Jurassic Park to come and visit
                    this place and buy a treat, specifically the Raspberry Panna
                    Cotta.

                    This shop has an amazing atmosphere, and the people are really
                    nice. The treats are to die for, especially the Donauwelle, just
                    a quick stop by for each time I go back to the lodge.
